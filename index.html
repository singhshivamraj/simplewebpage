        <h1>Welcome to My Webpage</h1>
        <p>Hi, I’m Shivam Raj, a second-year B.Tech student from Subharti University, currently maintaining a 7.0 CGPA.
            I scored 72% in 12th and 65% in 10th.
            I’m passionate about full-stack web development. I’ve worked with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React on the
            frontend, and I’m learning C# and ASP.NET for the backend.
            I’ve built projects like a portfolio website, to-do app, weather app, and I’m building a Myntra clone. I’ve
            also completed certifications in Web Development and Soft Skills.
            I’m a quick learner, a team player, and always curious to learn more. Right now, I’m looking for a
            full-stack development internship to apply my skills and gain real-world experience. I’m comfortable in both
            English and Hindi."</p>
